									We continue to create the Small School Integrated System (SSIS) for the MAC Learning center that was started in the summer of the same year by other IT interns. The group aims for its completion so the task were divided amongst five. The programming languages that were used for this system are PHP and JavaScript, though it was not taught in our school we were able to managed building the system by 
									researching online and studying the languages hands-on. As the front-end developer of the team, I was
									able to develop a new UI design for the system using Bootstrap.

											<h3>Recommendation</h3>
